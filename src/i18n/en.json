    "paragraph1": "Hello! I'm Mehmet Halit. For me, software is a journey of passion that started with a spark of curiosity I saw in a magazine and turned every opportunity into a quest to write code. It all began with discovering the excitement of coding with blocks on Code.org and turned into a concrete goal with the first Python lines I wrote in high school.",
    "paragraph2": "Throughout this journey, I not only learned different technologies but also adopted them as tools to solve problems. I opened the doors to the mobile world with Kotlin, solved the logic behind game mechanics with Unity, and built powerful backend systems with FastAPI. Each project became an opportunity for me to put theoretical knowledge into practice and continuously improve.",
    "paragraph3": "Today, I see artificial intelligence not as a competitor, but as an enhancer that amplifies creativity. The timeline on the right summarizes the important milestones in this learning and adaptation process."
