    "paragraph1": "Hello! I'm Mehmet Halit. For me, software is a journey of passion that began with a spark of curiosity I saw in a magazine, turning every opportunity into a quest to write code. It all started with discovering the excitement of block-based coding on Code.org and turned into a concrete goal with my first Python lines in high school.",
    "paragraph2": "Throughout this journey, I not only learned different technologies, but also adopted using them as tools to solve problems. I opened the doors to the mobile world with Kotlin, solved the logic behind game mechanics with Unity, and built powerful backend systems with FastAPI. Each project was an opportunity for me to put theoretical knowledge into practice and constantly improve.",
    "paragraph3": "Today, I view artificial intelligence not as a competitor, but as an enhancer that augments creativity. The timeline on the right summarizes the important milestones in this learning and adaptation process."
